### Block
"Block" refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups known as "blocks".


### blockchain
A blockchain is a public database that is updated and shared across many computers in a network.

### Chain
"Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically references its parent. In other words, blocks get chained together. The data in a block cannot change without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the entire network.

### Nodes
Every computer in the network must agree upon each new block and the chain as a whole. These computers are known as "nodes". Nodes ensure everyone interacting with the blockchain has the same data. To accomplish this distributed agreement, blockchains need a consensus mechanism.
