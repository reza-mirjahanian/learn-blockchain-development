Since Ethereum is a protocol, this means there can be multiple independent "networks" conforming to this protocol that do not interact with each other.

Networks are different Ethereum environments you can access for development, testing, or production use cases. Your Ethereum account will work across the different networks but your account balance and transaction history wont carry over from the main Ethereum network


### Mainnet

Mainnet is the primary public Ethereum production blockchain, where actual-value transactions occur on the distributed ledger.

When people and exchanges discuss ETH prices, they're talking about Mainnet ETH.
