Oracles are data feeds that connect Ethereum to off-chain, real-world information so that you can query data in your smart contracts. For example, prediction market dapps use oracles to settle payments based on events. A prediction market may ask you to bet your ETH on who will become the next president of the United States. They'll use an oracle to confirm the outcome and payout to the winners.

### Chainlink API Call

[Chainlink API Calls](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request)  are the easiest way to get data from the off-chain world in the traditional way the web works: API calls. Doing a single instance of this and having only one oracle makes it centralized by nature. To keep it truly decentralized, a smart contract platform would need to use numerous nodes found in an  [external data market](https://market.link/).
