In the Ethereum universe, there is a single, canonical computer (called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM) whose state everyone on the Ethereum network agrees on. Everyone who participates in the Ethereum network (every Ethereum node) keeps a copy of the state of this computer.

Ethereum currently uses a [proof-of-work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) consensus mechanism.

## ETHER
The purpose of ether, the cryptocurrency, is to allow for a market for computation. Such a market provides an economic incentive for participants to verify and execute transaction requests and provide computational resources to the network.
